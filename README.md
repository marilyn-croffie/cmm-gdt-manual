# CMM Tutorial Manual

A comprehensive guide for operating Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) using PC-DMIS software, with a focus on geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T).

## Overview

This tutorial manual was developed for ME 203 students at Minnesota State University, Mankato. It provides step-by-step instructions for CMM operation, from basic setup through advanced tolerance analysis including form tolerances, orientation tolerances, and true position measurements.

## Contents

- CMM fundamentals and components
- PC-DMIS software setup and configuration
- Manual datum specification and alignment procedures
- Dimensioning techniques (circles, surface angles, fillets)
- Form tolerances (flatness, cylindricity)
- Orientation tolerances (parallelism, perpendicularity)
- True position tolerances (RFS and MMC)
- Safety procedures and best practices
- Quick reference guide

## Key Topics Covered

- **Machine Operation**: Hand controller usage, probe positioning, and safety protocols
- **Software Configuration**: PC-DMIS setup, CAD file importing, and vector normalization
- **Measurement Techniques**: Point collection, datum establishment, and feature identification
- **GD&T Analysis**: Comprehensive tolerance evaluation and reporting

## Target Audience

This manual is designed for engineering students and professionals learning CMM operation and PC-DMIS software for quality control and metrology applications.
